## Introduction

In this repository, I've explored and implemented various concepts and tools related to building web APIs using Express.js and GraphQL. The primary focus has been on creating a robust API architecture with user authentication capabilities and seamless integration with different database systems.

## Technologies

- **Express.js**: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used as the foundation for building the API.
- **GraphQL**: A powerful query language for APIs that enables efficient data retrieval tailored to the client's needs.
- **Authentication**: Implementation of user authentication to secure the API endpoints and protect sensitive data.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for demonstrating database integration with Express.js.
- **SQL**: Integration with SQL databases for scenarios requiring relational data modeling.

## Features

- User Registration and Login: Implementing a secure user registration and login system with proper validation.
- Access Control: Ensuring authorized access to certain routes and data based on user roles and permissions.
- GraphQL Queries and Mutations: Defining GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with the API.
- Database CRUD Operations: Performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on database records.
- Error Handling: Proper handling of errors and validation failures to provide meaningful responses.
